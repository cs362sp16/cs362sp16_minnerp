BUG: smithy card only adds two cards instead of three.
PRIORITY: Low
SEVERITY: Low

When testing the smithy card with my cardtest1 tester, my test
would fail every time. When I checked the numbers I was testing,
I saw that only two new cards were added with smithy instead of
three. I checked the code and this is because the loop to draw
three cards is for(i=1; i<3; i++), which only adds two cards,
not three.
