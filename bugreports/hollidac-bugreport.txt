BUG: remodel card discards incorrect card from hand.
PRIORITY: Low
SEVERITY: Low

When testing the remodel card with my randomtestcard2 tester, I noticed
my tester failed on many different seeds. I checked what was going on in
the debugger, and I saw that the new card sometimes costed more than
it should have. I checked the code and saw that the cost is checked for 
the choice1 variable in the player's hand, but the card that is discarded
is from the variable handPos. The discard should discard choice1 instead.
