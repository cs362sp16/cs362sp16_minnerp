unittestbugs

After running all 8 of my unit tests, I did find one bug. 
It was testing the sea hag card. There appears to be 
multiple problems with this card. One problem is it seems 
to decrement all other players cards by 3 instead of 1. 
Also, I didn't see that a curse card was added to every deck.
