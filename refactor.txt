Assignment 1
Refactor Explanation

I refactored the cards: adventurer, councilRoom, feast, mine, and remodel 
into their own functions and called them within the switch statement. 
I included the prototypes for the functions within dominion_helpers.h,
and added the functions themselves at the bottom of dominion.c.
I refactored the functions by copying the entire contents of the
switch case from that card into the function. I then determined
any variables the card was dependent on and added them as arguments
to the card function. I also removed a few unused variables afterwards.
