The functions refactored were:
	adventurer card
	council room card
	feast card
	mine card
	remodel func

The method I used to refactor this code was simple. I would cut the code from the switch statement and paste it inside a function. I would then call that function in place of the refactored code. Finally I would look over the code for variables that need to be passed into the function in order for it to work. I would include these variables in the parameters, and pass them as arguments inside the switch statement.
